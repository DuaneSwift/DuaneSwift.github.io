    <h3 class="panel-title">My Website - duaneswift.com | HTML/CSS</h3>
  </div>
  <div class = "panel-body">
   <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> The idea for this website came from me really wanting to legitimize myself as a Computer Science major - I mean,
	  which CS major <i>doesn't</i> have one? </li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> Beyond this, however beyond that trivial reason, was to sort of "dive" head first into the world of web development,
	  and teach myself CSS and HTML, and whatever I needed to make this website work as I want it to. It is very much a work
	  in progress, so this section probably will be updated soon!</li>

  <div class="panel-two">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Music Editor | Java</h3>
  </div>
   <div class = "panel-body">
   <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Read and Play Music from pre-made txt files</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> This was a more interesting project - one that took a lot of my time and sanity. This was my first experience with the designing
	  of a full project from scratch - i.e., I built the model for the system and a basic view for the controller using JavaFX.
	  Along the way, I learnt a lot of new programming methods and patterns.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="panel-three">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Coin Game | Java</h3>
  </div>
   <div class = "panel-body">
   <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Make the last move toward the "front" of the board. All three parts of the CVM was built for this game.</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> Relatively simple game to make, it was fun to do!</li>
</ul>

  <div class="panel-four">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Whist | Java</h3>
  </div>
<div class = "panel-body">
<ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> To win the most hands. There are variants of this game, one in which there is a Trump card
	  that takes precidence if played during a turn where it hasn't been played. </li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> This project was a layer by layer building up, emphasizing the importance of considering visibility, design of elements, 
  invariants, abstracting ideas away from the problem at hand and why these particular concepts allow for easy development..</li>

    <h3 class="panel-title">Maze Game | Java</h3>
  </div>
  <div class = "panel-body">
  <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> To make it through a randomly generated maze</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> This game was interesting to develop, mainly because there was need to use binary trees to build the maze etc. It was an interesting cross between 
	  what one learns in Discrete-type lectures, and its application into actual coding. </li>

    <h3  class="panel-title">Frogger | Racket</h3>
  </div>
   <div class = "panel-body">
   <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Make it across several streams, by jumping on logs that float from LTR and RTL</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> Building this was my first introduction into the world of "dynamic" or responsive programming, i.e., making programs that respond to input.
	  This was relatively easy to do, notwithstanding the corner cases.</li>

    <h3  class="panel-title">Forbidden Island | Java</h3>
  </div>
   <div class = "panel-body">
   <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Make it to the helicopter/rebuild a helicopter before the island sinks with rising tides.</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> This is a game that I wish to never make again. I do appreciate the concepts that came along with it, though - i.e., The considerations that had to come
	  into play when deciding how to render the 1024x1024 grid, deciding how to do that grid in the first place, and the high consideration of corner cases etc.</li>

  <div class="panel-four">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Laundry Management | C</h3>
  </div>
<div class = "panel-body">
<ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Create a system that makes a running record of transactions, receipt generation and stock management of an existing Laundry business.</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> This project was relatively simple, very administrative-like, and it was my first instance of directly interacting with files/writing to files.</li>

  <div class="panel-five">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Housing System | Pascal</h3>
  </div>
  <div class = "panel-body">
  <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Create a system that assigns houses/determines if someone qualifies for a house.</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> In retrospect, this was incredibly simple to do - equivalent of a few functions in Java or C, but it was the beginning of my introduction into programming
  so I think it's worthwhile putting here</li>

   <div class = "panel-body">
   <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Works exactly as normal tetris.</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> This was a difficult project to write in Racket, mainly because of posns, and figuring out how to code when blocks could "disappear" etc.</li>

  </div>
   <div class = "panel-body">
   <ul>
  <li><b>Objective:</b> Create an Android app to navigate through myNEU - Collaboration with Alexander Kavourias</li>
  <li><b>Thoughts:</b> This project started, i.e., in a similar way to this website. I wanted to learn how to make android apps, so I started this. While I made the app,
  accessing the school's servers legally was another issue, so we decided to abandon the project</li>
