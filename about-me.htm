      A relatively large school in Boston, Northeastern University has been quickly rising
	  in the rankings over the last few years. This is a school that's highly oriented
	  toward experiential learning, so that anyone who graduates from here is almost
	  certainly guaranteed to not only have had a quality education, but to have relevant
	  work experience, which is essential to transitioning into the work place seamlessly.
	  
	  I am a 2nd year Computer Science and Linguistics major.

      I am a born and raised son of Trinidad and Tobago. It is a huge part of my identity as a person, from the
	  culture, to the food, to the people, to my way of thinking. Despite being the 3rd richest country in the
	  Western Hemisphere, Trinidad and Tobago has yet to realize it's full potential - a potential I hope to be
	  a big part of helping be realized.

      This scholarship is given by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to the top performers in the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination.

      I love languages - all kinds! I'm both a CS and Linguistics major, so the study of languages really is interesting to me. Away from the technical side of things though,
	  puedo hablar espanol y enseno fala portugues - yes I'm aware I'm missing all of the accents and tildes and circumflexes. But generally speaking, I like to pick up different
	  phrases from different languages, and it wouldn't be an unsurprising thing for you to hear me speak 4 different languages in one sentence - It's just what I do.
